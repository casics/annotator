The CASICS Annotator is a browser-based annotation interface for CASICS (the Comprehensive and Automated Software Inventory Creation System).  It is used by CASICS annotators to add ontology terms to repository records in the database.

☀ Introduction
-----------------------------

CASICS (the Comprehensive and Automated Software Inventory Creation System) is a project to create a proof of concept that uses machine learning techniques to analyze source code in software repositories and classify the repositories.  To do this, we need to generate a labeled training set consisting of repositories labeled with ontology terms by human evaluators.  The CASICS Annotator is the interface we use to do the labeling.

The CASICS Annotator is written in a combination of Python and JavaScript.  The lower-level command line interface is written in Python, while the browser-based interface is written in JavaScript.  The command-line interface program (called simply `annotator`) is used to start the JavaScript portion using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 


☛ Installation and configuration
--------------------------------

The CASICS Annotator relies on two network services to do its work: [LoCTerms](https://github.com/casics/locterms), a database of terms from the Library of Congress Subject Headings, and the [CASICS database server](https://github.com/casics/server).  Before using the annotation system, both of those servers need to be running.
